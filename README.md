This is a RESTful web app that I am working on as I focus more on deep learning Java. 
The service itself is based on the Spring framework. Additionally, I also 
plan to create an android client for the service (to hone my Java skills further).
Features will be added and readme updated and I gain more familiarity with 
Spring and Android development.
